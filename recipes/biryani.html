    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
      reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
      as Ramadan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For
      biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
